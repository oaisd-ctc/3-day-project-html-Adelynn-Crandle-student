            Hello, I'm Zoe, a 17-year-old senior with a keen interest in game design. Throughout my high school years,
            I've been actively engaged in soccer, demonstrating teamwork and discipline. While I'm known for my reserved
            demeanor, my dedication to creative pursuits, particularly in cooking and the arts, showcases my versatility.
            I've navigated personal challenges, including sensitivity to loud noises due to my mother's past experiences
            with PTSD, yet I maintain a composed exterior. The beach serves as a retreat for me, offering inspiration and
            relaxation. I possess a unique trait with double-jointed elbows, reflecting adaptability and resilience.
            Looking ahead, I am focused on pursuing higher education to delve into the intricate world of game design. My
            commitment to excellence and passion for creativity make me a dedicated candidate for future endeavors.
